## Autoregressive linear models

### Experiments

- Transformers
    - implement gradient clipping

### Next steps

- Least squares in this model (rate is not dependent on _mixing time_)
- Regime of interest: d^2 p >> N T >> d r p
- Matrix factorization in the model side  (_stationary_)
- Nuclear norm regularization
- Tradeoff between T and K
